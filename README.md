Example ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC Web Application with Entity Framework

This is an example MVC application using ASP.NET Core 2.2, it uses database first Entity Framework,
I also added data annotations to the EF model classes so a name other than the table name could
be used for the DbSet variables in the Context file.
